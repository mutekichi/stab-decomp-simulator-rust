/// Represents a simulated quantum state, providing the primary interface for quantum computation simulation.
///
/// `QuantumState` is the central struct for manipulating the results of a quantum circuit simulation.
/// It encapsulates the internal state representation (based on the stabilizer decomposition method)
/// and provides a high-level API for performing various quantum operations and analyses.
///
/// ## Features
///
/// This simulator utilizes the stabilizer decomposition method, which offers high performance,
/// especially for circuits dominated by Clifford gates.
/// Non-Clifford gates, such as the T-gate, are handled using gate teleportation.
/// The computational cost is measured by the number of stabilizer states: χ (`stabilizer_rank`) held internally.
///
/// ## Typical Workflow
///
/// 1. Construct a quantum circuit using [`QuantumCircuit`].
/// 2. Compile the circuit into a [`QuantumState`] using [`QuantumState::from_circuit`].
/// 3. Perform operations such as [`measure`](Self::measure), [`sample`](Self::sample), or [`exp_value`](Self::exp_value) (expectation value calculation).
/// 4. If needed, additional clifford gates can be applied directly to the state using methods like
///    [`apply_x`](Self::apply_x), [`apply_h`](Self::apply_h), etc.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use stab_decomp_simulator_rust::prelude::{QuantumCircuit, QuantumState};
/// use stab_decomp_simulator_rust::types::PauliString;
/// use std::str::FromStr;
///
/// // 1. Build a quantum circuit
/// let mut circuit = QuantumCircuit::new(2);
/// circuit.apply_h(0);
/// circuit.apply_cx(0, 1);
/// circuit.apply_t(1); // A non-Clifford gate
///
/// // 2. Compile the circuit into a QuantumState
/// let mut state = QuantumState::from_circuit(&circuit).unwrap();
///
/// // 3. Perform operations on the state
/// // Sample measurement outcomes
/// let shots = 1024;
/// let samples = state.sample(&[0, 1], shots, None).unwrap();
/// println!("Measurement samples: {:?}", samples);
///
/// // Calculate an expectation value
/// let pauli_z0 = PauliString::from_str("ZI").unwrap();
/// let exp_val = state.exp_value(&pauli_z0).unwrap();
